# Under-The-Arch

This project is for a fictional bar/restaurant/entertainment venue, in a fictional area of a real Irish town.

The inspiration for the name came the outdoor image used, with the entrance door appearing as if it's under the arch, albeit on the far side of the canal as well as the arch image taken from FontAwesome.

This a one-page (index.html) site detailing the services offered.
Buttons to "Sign-Up!", "Restaurant Reservation" and "Event Listings" are also provided the navigation bar for ease of access if you know what you want when you enter the site without needing to scroll any further. This main page introduces the business and provides details of its history up to the current day. The bar, restaurant and venue sections provide details of their opening hours as well as services provided. Each of these areas contains a large inviting image from within the location itself to entice customers to visit. Each of these images can be clicked on to return to the top of the page.

All the images and details provided are easily updated from within the index.html pages. 
The Event listings page is a similarly easily updated page. This page provides the entertainment listings both as being viewable in the browser or downloadable for punters/people/businesses which may find such a listing easy to have saved within their own devices or printed off so they can have it to hand
 
## UX

This site is a reference point for locals, visitors to the area or people passing through.
As a one-page site it contains details across all aspects of the business. 

The site could be used by people/businesses for situations similar to the ones detailed below.
 
i)   As the business owner this is a way of providing up to date and relevant information about the business and the services it              provides via a concise and appealing website - 

     - This is provided through an easily updateable and concise website.

ii)   As a tourist/visitor to the area I wish to find a destination where I can get food and have a few drinks during my stay. 

iii) 	As a local I would like to know what times that the bar and restaurant is open and on which days as we often have friends and    relations who come to visit and we like to take them out and provide a taste of what the area has to offer in food drink and entertainment.

iv)  	I’m a travelling business person and I’m travelling through this area early in the morning (7.45am) with a  bit of time to spare  and I would like to know if there’s somewhere I could get a nice coffee to take-away or sit -in and enjoy.

     - Items ii, iii and iv are covered through a concise website with the opening hours provided beside each section.
       Also, by signing up you could have these details provided to your phone.

v)  	As a music fan/local resident I wish to find out the upcoming event listings for the venue so that I can decide if there are any upcoming events that I wish to go to. 

vi).	As a bus/taxi service provider or local business (bar, restaurant, B&B, hotel, etc.) I can look at the upcoming events and see if  any of the upcoming acts would attract a lot of attention, people to the area and could make business decisions in advance of how we can also attract some of the people to use our services & facilities as well i.e. how many buses and/or size of buses (mini-buses/coaches etc.) we would need to make available.    

     -  Items v and vi are covered by the events listings page which can be viewed or downloaded.

## Features
 
### Existing Features

Feature 1: I used the inverse colour combination of a very Irish symbol, the colours of a drink of Guinness. Also, the "Sign-Up!" and                "Restaurant Booking" forms again use the same colours inverted again appearing like a pint of Guinness with narrow long                form structures.

Feature 2: Flexible design where the website can be viewed across devices and browsers with no loss of information, functionality                  or causing poor user experience.

Feature 3: The navigation bar contains details of the business, what it offers within the business and a selection of buttons providing            quick links to the signing up with the business, restaurant reservations and event listings. This also scrolls with the user            as they scroll down or up through the site. Customers who sign-up can select only the area or areas they wish to be kept up              to date on if they wish or general if for all.  

Feature 4: The navigation bar is contained across the top of the website & scrolls with you as you move down through the site.
           In all screens larger than small screen sizes the navigation bar displays the services, name and the buttons across the top              of the pages. 
           On smaller screens the navigation bar is reduced to listing the services provided, the name and logo. At these screen sizes              the buttons appear under a navigation button to save on screen real estate.        
           
Feature 5: The "Sign-Up!" button allows for the user to sign up and keep informed of all that is happening at Under the Arch or a                  more specific list selected by the user. This form also contains links to the main social media sites that would be of                  interest to this type of business.

Feature 6: The "Restaurant Booking" button/form allows for a user to request a reservation. Due to limitation in the coding the option            provided is for the user to request a date & time and for the reservation staff to confirm or discuss with the user.

Feature 7: The "Event Listings" button allows for the user to look at upcoming events as provided by Under the Arch. 
           This can be viewed on-line in a new tab opened separately to the Under the Arch page, printed off, downloaded or bookmarked. 

Feature 8: Clicking on any of the images in sections across the website will allow the user to return to the top of the screen without            the need for the user to scroll through the page.

Feature 9: The footer contains the details and location of the business along with the phone and email contact details. Links to the              popular social media sites as well as TripAdvisor which would be relevant to this business are also provided here.  

Feature 10: The card feature from Bootstrap has been used to help provide the opening hours of the services i.e. bar/restaurant/venue               in each section as is relevant. These have been left large and clear in each section. 

Feature 11: The up to date event listing is available for either viewing or download from the website allowing for people to look at               the upcoming activities without needing to contact the business directly if they don’t wish to.

Feature 12: The footer contains the location, contact details and links to the main social media sites that would be of interest to                 this type of business.

### Features Left to Implement

When further modules and backend modules have been completed, I would like to add specific responses to the sign-up and provide a more 
complete reservation service where the reservation could be checked and confirmed back if available or not.
This could help the customer feel that the time they had spent signing up and/or making a reservation with Under the Arch was appreciated.  

## Technologies Used
   
HTML:
The project uses HTML for the general layout and text input of the elements on screen. 

CSS:
The project uses CSS to style many of the parameters/text input or lay-out in HTML.

Bootstrap: (https://getbootstrap.com/)
The project uses Bootstrap to help with the layout of the site via the grid system as well as setting out of general parameters throughout the site without the need for each specific area to be specifically laid out. 

The card functionality was also used to help the opening hours sections of the differing services across the business stand-out as well as keep them in line with the layout of the pages and website in general.

Font Awesome: (https://fontawesome.com/)
The project uses Font Awesome for images that help dramatise or further emphasise an element of the business i.e. Under the Arch beside the image of a large arch.


## Testing

Extensive testing was done across many devices through the Dev Tools emulator functionality on Chrome and it looked good across all devices tested. 

It was also tested on large screens as well as laptop screens. 
The site was also tested across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera and looked good and functioned as expected across these browsers as well.

In Internet Explorer, the website appears okay but the elements within the navigation bar all react unusually when they are hovered over as they move around as they do not do on the other browsers. 
Most functions can be performed as expected as well, although you need enter both the date in format dd/mm/yyyy and the time in order to fill in these sections.
It was also tested across several older versions of Internet Explorer under "Emulation" under the "Inspect element" heading.

The site was also tested across differing phones in real life scenarios including iPhone XR, iPhone 11, Sony XZ2 and again looked good and functioned as expected across these browsers as well.

1. A visitor to the site can see immediately what is available here as the services "Bar, Restaurant, Venue" are listed across the 
   navigation bar along with the name of the business across mobile and larger device sizes.

2. For devices larger than mobile devices the user is provided with a list of buttons/options for "Sign-Up!”, "Restaurant Bookings" and
   "Event Listings" so these options are easily accessible on arrival to the site.

3. In order to save screen real estate on mobile/smaller screen devices these buttons are placed within a navigation button but once 
   this button is clicked the dropdown provides the buttons as offered to those users using larger screens.  

4. Sign-Up button/form:
    A. From the main page (large screen) the user can click on the "Sign-Up" button in the navbar. 
       A(i) On smaller screens i.e. mobile devices the buttons are replaced by a navigation button to save on screen real estate and 
            upon clicking the navigation button, the list of buttons will appear on screen and the used can select from this list.  
            
    B. Here the user can enter their email and select the checkboxes of exactly what they want to be kept informed about.
    
    C. If the user tries to submit the form without a valid email address format an error message about the required fields appears.
    
    D. If the user tries to submit the form without a selection made i.e. "General", "Bar" etc. a relevant error message appears.
    
    E. If the user wishes to change their selection prior to submission they can click the "Reset" button to reset the form.
    
    F. The "Submit" button is there to enable the user to submit their contact information and selection(s).
    
    G. The "x" in the top corner can be clicked upon at any stage while in the form to close it down.
    
    H. Due to no back-end code after submission no success message appears.

 5. Restaurant Booking button/form:
     A. From the main page (large screen) the user can click on the "Restaurant Booking" button in the navbar. 
       A(i) On smaller screens i.e. mobile devices the buttons are replaced by a navigation button to save on screen real estate. 
            Upon clicking the navigation button, the list of buttons will appear on screen in a dropdown and the user can select the   
            "Restaurant Booking" button from this list. 
            
    B. Here the user can enter their name, email address, date and time for their reservation request to be contacted by the  
       reservation staff re: their reservation request.
       
    C. If the user tries to submit the form without a reservation name an error message about this required field appears.
    
    D. If the user tries to submit the form without a valid email address format an error message about this required field appears.
        
    E. If the user tries to submit the form without a reservation date an error message about this required field appears.
    
    F. If the user tries to submit the form without a reservation time an error message about this required field appears.
    
    G. If the user wishes to change their information or selection prior to submission rather than changing each field they can click 
       the "Reset" button to reset the form.
    
    H. The "Submit" button is there to enable the user to submit their contact information and request details.
    
    I. The "x" in the top corner can be clicked upon at any stage while in the form to close it down.
    
    J. Due to no back-end code after submission no success message appears.
    
 6. Event Listings button/page:
 
    A. From the main page (large screen) the user can click on the "Event Listings" button in the navbar. 
       A(i) On smaller screens i.e. mobile devices the buttons are replaced by a navigation button to save on screen real estate. 
            Upon clicking the navigation button, the list of buttons will appear on screen in a dropdown and the user can select the   
            "Event Listings" button from this list. 
            
    B. This will open the "Event Listings" in a separate tab to the "Under the Arch" page which will also remain open.
    
    C. From the newly opened tab the user will be able to look through the information to see if there are any bands, DJ's,
       performers appearing that they would like to see.
    
    D. The user will also be able to save down or print-off the listing as required should they need to i.e. local business owners as          listed in the UX section.
    
    E. Even if the user unintentionally closes out of this screen to soon, they will still have the "Under the Arch" tab they started 
       from open in their browser.  
    
    F. From a business perspective this listing is easily to update/replace and can be changed from month to month or as required with 
       little effort. Also, it can only be updated by those with access to the site itself.


## Deployment

I used GitHub, GitPod and GitHub pages for my project.

The code was written and compiled in GitPod, pushed to GitHub through the use of the git add , git commit -m, and git push commands and is hosted on GitHub pages at the master branch, any further updates added, committed and pushed would also be pushed to this branch. 
As the project changed from a multi-page project to a single page project there are pages listed in the repository and in the “Workings” folder in GitPod  that are no longer involved in the project but have been left in as part of the story of the life-cycle/evolution of the project. 

In order to run locally you can clone the repository:

   1.	Go to the main page of the repository in GitHub.
   2.	Click “Clone or download” (in the green box).
   3.	From the “Clone with HTTPS” area copy the link.
   4.	In your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) open Git Bash. 
   5.	Change the current location to the location the clone is to be saved.
   6.	Type “git clone” and paste in the link copied earlier.
   7.	Press “Enter” to complete the process.

  ### Acknowledgements
  
• First, I would like to thank my wife, my boys and my family for their support, understanding and assistance through-out the             project. 

• I would like to thank my mentor Ade (gbenga_mentor) who provided guidance through-out the project.
  I'd also like to thank Eventyret_mentor and JosV for some extremely useful pointers which helped me figure out some points I was       working through as well as the Slack community.

•	I received inspiration for this project from my travels and my enjoyment of exploring similar businesses when I’m away on holiday or   visiting various areas within Ireland. I would often research such businesses prior to going away and would look for                   recommendations from people who previously have been as well as from locals the area once I arrive.

•	As I (and most people) enjoy going to places that provide good food, good drinks (both craft and regular) and good entertainment I     created a website for a place that I would want to visit if I was in the area or even to go to just because I found out about it. 

•	Elements of the code within this program will also contain ideas and code I came across throughout the Code Institute courses text     and videos worked through so far.
