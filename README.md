# Under-The-Arch

This project is for a fictional bar/restaurant/entertainment venue, in a fictional area of a real Irish town.

The inspiration for the name came the outdoor image used, with the entrance door appearing as if it's under the arch, albeit on the far side of the canal as well as the arch image taken from FontAwesome.

This a one page (index.html) site detailing the services offered.
Buttons to "Sign-Up!", "Restaurant Reservation" and "Event Listings" are also provided the navigation bar for ease of access if you know what you want when you enter the site without needing to scroll any further. This main page introduces the business and provides details of its history up to the current day. The bar, restaurant and venue sections provide details of their opening hours as well as services provided. Each of these areas contains a large inviting image from within the location itself to entice customers to visit. Each of these images can be clicked on to return to the top of the page.

All of the images and details provided are easily updated from within the index.html pages. 
The Event listings page is a similarly easily updated page. This page provides the entertainment listings both as being viewable in the browser or downloadable for punters/people/businesses which may find such a listing easy to have saved within their own devices or printed off so they can have it to hand.   
 
## UX

This site is a reference point for locals, visitors to the area or people passing through.
As a one page site it contains details across all aspects of the business. 

The site could be used by people/businesses for situations similar to the ones detailed below.
 
i)   As the business owner this is a way of providing up to date and relevant information about the business and the services it              provides via a concise and appealing website - 

     - This is provided through an easily updateable and concise website.

ii)   As a tourist/visitor to the area I wish to find a destination where I can get food and have a few drinks during my stay. 

iii) 	As a local I would like to know what times that the bar and restaurant is open and on which days as we often have friends and    relations who come to visit and we like to take them out and provide a taste of what the area has to offer in food drink and entertainment.

iv)  	I’m a travelling business person and I’m travelling through this area early in the morning (7.45am) with a  bit of time to spare  and I would like to know if there’s somewhere I could get a nice coffee to take-away or sit -in and enjoy.

     - Items ii, iii and iv are covered through a concise website with the opening hours provided beside each section.
       Also by signing up you could have these details provided to your phone.

v)  	As a music fan/local resident I wish to find out the upcoming event listings for the venue so that I can decide if there are any upcoming events that I wish to go to. 

vi).	As a bus/taxi service provider or local business (bar, restaurant, B&B, hotel, etc.) I can look at the upcoming events and see if  any of the upcoming acts would attract a lot of attention, people to the area and could make business decisions in advance of how we can also attract some of the people to use our services & facilities as well i.e. how many buses and/or size of buses (mini-buses/coaches etc.) we would need to make available.    

     -  Items v and vi are covered by the events listings page which can be viewed or downloaded.


## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

Feature 1: I used the inverse colour combination of a very Irish symbol, the colours of a drink of Guinness. Also the "Sign-Up!" and                "Restaurant Booking" forms again use the same colours inverted again appearring like a pint of Guinness with narrow long                form structures.

Feature 2: Flexible design where the website can be viewed across devices and browsers with no loss of information, functionality                  or causing poor user experience.

Feature 3: The navigation bar contains details of the business, what it offers within the business and a selection of buttons providing            quick links to the signing up with the business, restaurant resevrations and event listings. This also scrolls with the user            as they scroll down or up through the site. Customers who sign-up can select only the area or areas they wish to be kept up              to date on if they wish or general if for all.  

Feature 4: The navigation bar is contained across the top of the website & scrolls with you as you move down through the site.
           In all screens larger than small screen sizes the navigation bar displays the services, name and the buttons across the top              of the pages. 
           On smaller screens the navigation bar is reduced to listing the services provided, the name and logo. At these screen sizes              the buttons appear under a navigation button to save on screen real estate.        
           
Feature 5: The "Sign-Up!" button allows for the user to sign upo and keep informed of all that is happening at Unbder The Arch or a                more specific list selected by the user.
           This form also contains links to the main social media sites that would be of interest to this type of business.

Feature 6: The "Restaurant Booking" button/form allows fopr a user to request a reservation. Due to limitation in the coding the option            provided is for the user to request a date & time and for the reservatio staff to confirm or discuss with the user.

Feature 7: The "Event Listings" button allows for the user to look at upcoming events as provided by Under The Arch. 
           This can be veiwed on-line in a new tab opened separately to the Under The Arch page, printed off, downloaded or bookmarked. 

Feature 5: Clicking on any of the images in sections across the website will allow the user to return to the top of the screen without              the need for the user to scroll through the page.

Feature 6: The footer contains the details and location of the business along with the phone and email contact details. Links to the                popular social media sites as well as Tripadvisor which would be relevant to this business are also provided here.  

Feature 7: The card feature from Bootstrap has been used to help provide the opening hours of the services i.e. bar/restaurant/venue in            each section as is relevant. These have been left large and clear in each section. 

Feature 8: The up to date event listing is available for either viewing or download from the website allowing for people to look at the            upcoming activities without needing to contact the business directly if they don’t wish to.

Feature 9: The footer contains the location, contact details and links to the main social media sites that would be of interest to this            type of business.


### Features Left to Implement

When further modules and backend modules have been completed I would like to add specific responses to the sign-up and provide a more 
complete reservation service where the reservation could be checked and confirmed back if available or not.
This could help the customer feel that the time they had spent signing up and/or making a reservation with Under The Arch was appreciated.  

## Technologies Used
   
HTML:
The project uses  HTML for the general layout and text input of the elements on screen. 

CSS:
The project uses CSS to style many of the parameters/text input or lay-out in HTML.

Bootstrap: (https://getbootstrap.com/)
The project uses Bootstrap to help with the layout of the site via the grid system as well as setting out of general parameters throughout the site without the need for each specific area to be specifically laid out. 

The card functionality was also used to help the opening hours sections of the differing services across the business stand-out as well as keep them in line with the layout of the pages and website in general.

Font Awesome: (https://fontawesome.com/)
The project uses Font Awesome for images that help dramatise or further emphasise an element of the business i.e. Under The Arch beside the image of a large arch.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

1. A visitor to the site can see at a glance what is available here as the services "Bar, Restaurant, Venue" are listed across the 
   navigation bar along with the name of the business across mobile and larger device sizes.

2. For devices larger than mobile devices the user is provided with a list of buttons/options for "Sign-Up!, "Restaurant Bookings" and
   "Event Listings" so these option are easily accessible on arrival to the site.

3. In order to save screen real estate on mobile/smaller screen devices these buttons are placed within a navigation button but once 
   this button is clicked the dropdown provides the buttons as offered to those users using larger screens.  

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

Extensive testing was done across many devices through the Dev Tools emulator functionality on Chrome and it looked good across all devices tested. 

It was also tested on large screens as well as laptop screens. 
The site was also tested across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Internet Explorer and looked good and functioned as expected across these browsers as well.

The site was also tested across differing phones in real life scenarios including iPhone5, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, Sony XZ2 and Samsung A10 and again looked good and functioned as expected across these browsers as well. ********



## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

  ### Acknowledgements

• I would like to thank my mentor Ade (gbenga_mentor) who provided guidance through-out the project.
  I'd also like to thank Eventyret_mentor and JosV for some very useful pointers which helped me and the Slack community.

•	I received inspiration for this project from my travels and my enjoyment of exploring similar businesses when I’m away on holiday or     visiting various areas within Ireland. I would often research such businesses prior to going away and would look for recommendations     from people who previously have been as well as from locals the area once I arrive.

•	As I (and most people) enjoy going to places that provide good food, good drinks (both craft and regular) and good entertainment I       created a website for a place that I would definitely want to visit if I was in the area or even to go to just because I found out       about it. 

•	Elements of the code within this program will also contain ideas and code I came across throughout the Code Institute courses text and   videos worked through so far.
